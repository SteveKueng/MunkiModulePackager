# MunkiModulePackager
MunkiModulePackager is a CLI tool for downloading and packaging PyPi module sources for distribution via Munki.
Given a specified module(s) the tool will search PyPi for the tarred, zipped source(s). If a module source is found it will download, unzip, and extract the source, then package it into a dmg for distribution via Munki. Info is extracted from the source's PKG-INFO file and combined with that generated by the logic of the tool to create a plist for use in installation via Munki. The aforementioned dmg and plist will be created in the current working directory of the tool-wielding user.
```
usage: PythonPackager.py [-h] module [module ...]

positional arguments:
  module      name of a PyPi module

optional arguments:
